# READMEs (WIP):


## * [Graph](./docs/Graph.md)
## * [Service](./docs/Service.md)
## * [Router](./docs//Router.md)

This is the new Brains@Play core, which seeks to be a true graph based programming api and unified interface for microservices and otherwise automating major frontend and backend execution needs with minimal mental work (once you learn the basics).

The core stack of classes are as follows:
### * [Graph](./Graph.ts) 
GraphNode and Graph
### * [Service](./services/Service.ts)
### * [Router](./routers/Router.ts)
### * [UserRouter](./routers/users/User.router.ts)


This is kind of a bloated example right now but this is actively being used to test bugs and think even bigger for the framework:
