`brainsatplay` is a framework for quickly assembling interactive, high-performance web applications.

## Benefits
🔮 **Low Code:** Our browser-based [editor] makes it easy to wire together your application logic using the [visualscript] library.

🧩 **Familiar:** We don't lock users into unnecessary abstractions. Just format code files as ES Modules!

⚡ **Performant:** High-performance event-based logic using the [graphscript] library.

🌐 **Social:** Derivative components can be published as NPM packages and registered on the [components] library to be shared with the world.

📜 **Radically Open:** This library is licensed under the AGPL license. All derivatives are also free and open-source software!

## Getting Started
Make sure to reference our complete documentation at [docs.brainsatplay.com](https://docs.brainsatplay.com).

## Roadmap
♿ **Inclusive:** Extend [visualscript] to become a fully accessible visual programming system. Use the [accessify] library to guarantee accessibility support for resulting applications through multimodal I/O support.

📡 **Backend Support:** Edit workspaces running in Node.js, local or the cloud.
