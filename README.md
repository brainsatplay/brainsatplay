# The Brains@Play Framework: Functional Building Blocks for the Web
[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/badge/chat-discord-7289da.svg?sanitize=true)](https://discord.gg/CDxskSh9ZB)

**The Brains@Play Framework** allows anyone to compose interactive, high-performance web applications and contribute to **an ecosystem of copyleft software infrastructure for open-source application development** on the Web. 

Extensive documentation for the Brains@Play Framework can be found at https://docs.brainsatplay.com.

## The Benefits
🔮 **Low Code:** Our browser-based [studio] makes it easy to wire together your application logic using the [visualscript] library.

🧩 **Familiar:** We don't lock users into unnecessary abstractions. Just format code files as ES Modules!

⚡ **Performant:** High-performance event-based logic using the [graphscript] library.

🌐 **Social:** Derivative components can be published as NPM packages and registered on the [components] library to be shared with the world.

📜 **Radically Open:** This library is licensed under the AGPL license. All derivatives are also free and open-source software!

> If we don't have something you'd like to see within this framework, feel free to propose your idea in the [Issues](https://github.com/brainsatplay/brainsatplay/issues) tab!

## Getting Started
Check out the [brainsatplay-starter-kit](https://github.com/brainsatplay/brainsatplay-starter-kit) to start developing your application with the Brains@Play Framework!

## Support
If you have questions about developing with [brainsatplay], feel free to start a conversation on [Discord](https://discord.gg/tQ8P79tw8j) or reach out directly to our team at [contact@brainsatplay.com](mailto:contact@brainsatplay.com).

## Contributing Guidelines
If you've created a plugin for [brainsatplay], make sure to link to the source `package.json` file with a pull request to [components].

We welcome anyone who would like to jump into the source code of our many [supporting libraries](#framework-libraries). At this time, however, **documentation changes may be a more appropriate entrypoint** for contribution to the Brains@Play Framework. Make sure to check out our [docs] repository and contribute there!

## Roadmap
♿ **Inclusive:** Extend [visualscript] to become a fully accessible visual programming system. Use the [accessify] library to guarantee accessibility support for resulting applications through multimodal I/O support.

📡 **Backend Support:** Edit workspaces running in Node.js, local or the cloud.
