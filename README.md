# brainsatplay
`brainsatplay` is a framework for quickly assembling interactive, high-performance web applications. 

Our mission is to enable open source biosensing and signal processing research, game, and education application development for everyone, We're solving a ton of typical web development problems in the process with a suite of custom frameworks leveraging the latest web APIs!

### Supporting Projects
- [**graphscript (core)**](https://github.com/brainsatplay/graphscript) provides easy graph-based workflow (state machine) programming, microservice architectures, and interoperable front and backend web frameworks!
- [**datastreams-api**](https://github.com/brainsatplay/datastreams-api) supports real-time data acquisition through the browser.
- [**visualscript**](https://github.com/brainsatplay/visualscript) allows for visual programming with the `brainsatplay` library.
- [**tinybuild**](https://github.com/brainsatplay/brainsatplay/tree/main/src/build) combines ultra fast and lightweight esbuild, hot reloading node and python (optional), and quick config/setup via boilerplate.
