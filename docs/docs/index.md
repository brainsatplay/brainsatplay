# Introduction

`brainsatplay` enables **interactive reactive programming** on the browserâ€”specifically for high-performance scientific computing applications that span multiple programming environments. 

## Our Values
- We take a **developer-first approach** with first-class TypeScript support.
- We take a user-first approach by prioritizing **inspectability and interactivity**.
- We use the latest Chromium browers (e.g. Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave Browser, etc.) to ensure the availability of the l**atest APIs for data acquisition** (e.g. Web Bluetooth, Web Serial, etc.).
- We use a Progressive Web App (PWA) to support **installable, reliable, and capable applications**.
- We leverage the inbuilt accessibility features of modern browsers to ensure **everyone can use apps built with Brains@Play tools**.
