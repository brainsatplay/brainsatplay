# graphscript
`graphscript` is the foundational library behind the logic of `brainsatplay`.

You can design very complicated systems in `graphscript` with very few lines of code.

1. You can use a [Graph](./graphs) to sequence behaviors.
2. You can use a [Socket](./sockets) to expose behaviors to networked environments.
3. You can use a [Router](./routers) to process varied commands from the network.

You can find more information about this library [here](https://github.com/brainsatplay/graphscript).
