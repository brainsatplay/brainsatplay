# Looking Ahead
You can design very complicated systems in Brains@Play with very few lines of code.

1. You can use a [Graph](../guides/graphs) to sequence behaviors.
2. You can use an [Endpoint](../guides/endpoints) to expose behaviors to networked environments.
3. You can use a [Router](../guides/routers) to process varied commands from the network.

Let's get started!
