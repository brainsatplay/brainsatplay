## Welcome to Brains@Play
---

**[brainsatplay.js](https://github.com/brainsatplay/brainsatplay) is an open-source library for incorporating biosignals into modern web applications.** We have developed [The Brains@Play Platform](https://app.brainsatplay.com) to host apps built by and for our community.


## Our Ethos
---

**Future biosensing intrastructure must be publicly available on the Web.** Accessible for developers and end-users alike, the Web allows for the seamless translation of state-of-the-art algorithms and applications from the lab / clinic / studio to the real world. 

In the realm of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), [BCI2000](https://github.com/cronelab/bci2000web) and [Timeflux](https://github.com/timeflux/timeflux_ui) have already joined the movement. 

Here's why we think you should take web-based (particularly browser-based) biosensing seriously.

### 1. Everyone Has A Brain
**Why not develop applications accessible to all of them?** Brains@Play creates neurotechnology with everyone by taking advantage of the universal interface of modern technology: the web browser. The Web is the only platform positioned to elevate all of society through widespread home use of neurofeedback and BCIs—both by healthy users *as well as* those with neurological disorders. Our device-agnostic data acquisition system standardizes data streams from a variety of devices so you don't have to worry about compatibility when developing applications.

### 2. Code for the Client
**We want biosensing applications to seamlessly transfer from your Github repository to the browser!** Whether or not you're connected to the internet, you should always have the opportunity to receive real-time information about your brain. The development of a Javascript BCI library, affordable hardware, and experiences that truly captivate users will extend the benefits of biosensing technology to all.

### 3. Access to our Brains and Bodies Requires Access to Source Code
Since Brains@Play is licensed under the GPLv3 license, **you must distribute your own source code under a GPLv3-compatible license if your software includes or modifies the Brains@Play codebase.** 

A full list of licenses that qualify as free software licenses, and are compatible with the GNU GPL, can be found [here](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.en.html).


## Use Cases
---

You should consider using Brains@Play if you're looking to:
- Distribute a complete biosensing app on the Web
- Rapidly design a Web interface for your native biosensing app
- Network your biosensing app through the Brainstorm to support social connection and/or remote data collection

### Claim BCI Bounties
The [USC Bridge Arts and Science Alliance](https://uscbasa.wixsite.com/mysite) has generously provided $2000 to fund "BCI Bounties" to solve hard problems in the neurotechnology space with Brains@Play. While we have yet to release this initiative, you can expect bounties on the following topics:

- [ERP Recognition](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2017.00109/full) over Web BLE by replicating [Brain Invaders](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.0107.pdf) ($250)
- An [SSVEP](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8553012) speller ($250)
- [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/) implementation for peer-to-peer data streaming ($250)
- [Automated artifact rejection](https://gitlab.ciirc.cvut.cz/open-source/rps) for online BCI experiments ($100)
- Unity, Unreal, and Godot plugins ($50 each)
- Build us the [BrainDAO](https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/16/the-tao-of-the-dao-or-how-the-autonomous-corporation-is-already-here/) and create a token that you can mine with your brain ($50).
- Train ML models (for whavever you want!) during use of a simple application/game.
- [MOABB](https://github.com/NeuroTechX/moabb) integration ($50). We also need a robust way to benchmark plugins in brainsatplay.js, including latency, performance, etc.
- One Bit Bonanza [Warioware]: "Micro-games" for single and multiplayer use ($5 per entry)

Each technical bounty must be accompanied by a demo applet showcasing the new feature.
