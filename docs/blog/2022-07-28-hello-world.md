Denizens of the Internet,

For too long, you have been considered passive consumers of the World Wide Web. Since the development of the first web browser-editor ([WorldWideWeb / Nexus](https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/WorldWideWeb.html)) in 1990, the web has transitioned into a passive, constrained medium for transaction.

Join us to reinvigorate its original mission: To make the internet accessible to everyone.

We are hosting a community application at https://brainsatplay.com. This was designed on top of the Web Application Specification Language (WASL) to allow for the entire web to be architected as an indexable set of composable units.

Explore it. Copy it. Remix it. Plagiarize it. Show us what you can do.
